<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/Selfie.jpeg" width="200" />
<p>My name is Dakota, and I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer. My journey to find a career for myself has been long and hard, 
  but coding has been most fun of all. I hope this course will provide me with the skills I need to work in this challenging and
interesting field.</p>

<p>As a woman of color, I know there will be a lot of challenges being that we are not often found in the tech space. However, I've
  discovered that nothing would make me happier than following in my father's footsteps and learning how to code.</p>

<p>In my personal life, I love fashion, organization, and creating YouTube videos. I consider myself a life-long learner, so I am always
  trying new things. I hope my passion for learning new things will serve me well in my future in tech. I also hope a career in tech
  opens me up to a future of traveling and experiencing life more fully. I want to make my family proud and have the life I have been
  longing for all these years.</p>
